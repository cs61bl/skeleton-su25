# CS 61BL Skeleton - Summer 2025

Welcome to the official **skeleton repository** for [CS 61BL](https://cs61bl.org/su25/), the Data Structures and Programming Methodology course offered in Summer 2025 at UC Berkeley.

This repository provides the base code, configuration, and structure required for all CS 61BL labs, projects, and assignments.

## 📚 Course Overview

**CS 61BL** is a rigorous introduction to data structures, algorithms, and Java programming, with an emphasis on good software engineering practices. This skeleton helps students begin each assignment with a consistent, organized codebase.

## 🛠️ Included in This Repository

* Starter code and project scaffolding for all course components
* Pre-configured development tools and settings
* Interfaces, abstract classes, and test scaffolding for each lab/project
* Code quality and style tools pre-integrated with course standards

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin working with the skeleton:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cs61bl/skeleton-su25.git
   cd skeleton-su25
   ```

2. **Set up your remote for course autograder integration:**

   Follow the [Lab 0 setup instructions](https://cs61bl.org/su25/labs/lab00/) to connect this skeleton to your private repository on GitHub Classroom.

3. **Install Java and development tools:**

   This course requires **Java 21** and supports **Visual Studio Code** or **IntelliJ IDEA**. See the [Environment Setup Guide](https://cs61bl.org/su25/labs/lab00/) for full instructions.

## 🧪 Assignments & Workflow

* Each lab or project will come with its own subfolder in this repository.
* You’ll write code, complete tests, and push changes to your GitHub Classroom repository.
* Use the provided `Makefile` or IDE build tools to compile and test your code.
* The skeleton includes basic unit tests, but you are expected to write your own for full coverage.

## ❗ Notes

* Do **not** modify files marked with `@DoNotModify` unless instructed.
* All assignments are submitted through your personal GitHub Classroom fork.
* Autograder results will be shown in *GradeScope*.
